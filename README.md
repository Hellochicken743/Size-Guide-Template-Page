# Size-Guide-Template-Page
A template for use in Cloudfy ecommerce system.

Cloudfy is the ecommerce system I was asked to build page layouts for.  This is an example of one.  
The Cloudfy platform unfortunately adds a lot of extra css to my custom code, so it's not ideal. 
I had to work around this to get the pages to work the way Samurai wanted me to. 

They asked for a simple expanding size guide for their customers.
